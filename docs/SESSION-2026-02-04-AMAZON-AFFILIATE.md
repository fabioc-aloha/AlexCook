# Session Log: Amazon Affiliate Links & Documentation Polish

**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Focus:** Amazon shopping list monetization + documentation improvements

---

## Summary

Transformed the Amazon shopping list from static text search terms into **185 clickable affiliate links** generating potential revenue, plus polished documentation with improved ASCII diagrams.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Amazon Affiliate Links

**Problem:** Shopping list had backtick-wrapped search terms that readers had to copy/paste manually.

**Solution:** Created scripts to generate clickable Amazon search URLs with affiliate tracking.

**Files Created:**
- `build/add-amazon-links.js` — Converts search terms to affiliate links (first-time use)
- `build/update-affiliate-tag.js` — Updates existing links with new affiliate tag

**Transformation:**
```markdown
# Before:
| **Chef's Knife** | Don't cheap out. | `Victorinox 8 inch chef knife` |

# After:
| **Chef's Knife** | Don't cheap out. | [🔍 Victorinox 8 inch chef knife](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Victorinox+8+inch+chef+knife&tag=alexcook05-20) |
```

**Results:**
- 185 clickable Amazon links
- All links include affiliate tag: `alexcook05-20`
- 🔍 prefix for visual indication
- Column header renamed from "Search Term" to "Shop"

---

### 2. Affiliate Disclosure

**Requirement:** Amazon Associates requires disclosure of affiliate relationship.

**Added to:** `book/20-amazon-shopping-list.md` (bottom of page)

```markdown
> **📋 Affiliate Disclosure:** The links in this chapter are affiliate links.
> As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases — at no extra cost
> to you. This helps support the cookbook and keeps Alex cooking up new recipes.
> Thank you for your support! ❤️
```

### 3. Documentation Polish

**PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md Updates:**
- Added visual flow diagram showing three output formats (GitHub → Print → Digital)
- Polished directory tree with emoji prefixes (📖, 🌐, 🔧, 📚, 🗄️)

---

### 4. Social Preview Improvements

**File:** `build/convert-social-preview.js`

**Improvement:** Better handling of mixed text+emoji lines with accurate character width calculations:
- Character width: `fontSize * 0.55`

## ⚠️ Dual-Maintenance Note

The Amazon shopping list exists in **two locations** that must stay in sync:

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `book/20-amazon-shopping-list.md` | PDF generation (print/digital) |
| `github-version/appendices/appendix-c-amazon-shopping-list/README.md` | GitHub web viewing |

**When updating affiliate links:**
1. Run `node build/add-amazon-links.js` for book version
2. Manually apply same transformation to GitHub version (script only targets book/)

**Future enhancement:** Consider updating `add-amazon-links.js` to process both files automatically.

With 185 affiliate links covering:
- Kitchen equipment ($50-500 items)
