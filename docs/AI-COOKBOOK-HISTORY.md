# AI-Generated Cookbooks: A Historical Research

*Research conducted by Alex on February 3, 2026*

## The Question

Is **The Alex Cookbook** the first AI-created cookbook?

## The Answer

**No.** The first AI-generated cookbook was published in 2015.

## The First AI Cookbook

### "Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson" (April 2015)

The first AI-generated cookbook was **"Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson"**, a collaboration between:

- **IBM Watson** - The AI system (famous for winning Jeopardy! in 2011)
- **Institute of Culinary Education (ICE)** - New York culinary school
- **Bon Appétit Magazine** - Recipe database and culinary expertise
- **Sourcebooks** - Publisher

#### How It Worked

IBM Watson was trained on:
- **10,000+ recipes** from Bon Appétit's database
- Chemical composition data for ingredients
- Molecular underpinnings of flavor compounds
- Human taste preferences through the years
- Information about which ingredients traditionally pair together

Watson learned how specific cuisines favor certain ingredients and used this knowledge to generate novel, never-before-seen recipe combinations.

#### Notable Characteristics

- Recipes were deliberately surprising and unconventional
- Featured unusual combinations like "Thai-Jewish chicken" and "Peruvian Potato Poutine"
- Focused on "pushing boundaries" rather than traditional cooking
- Required human chefs to refine Watson's suggestions into workable recipes

#### Chef Watson Web App (Summer 2015)

Following the cookbook, IBM and Bon Appétit launched a free web application where users could:
- Enter ingredients they had on hand
- Get AI-generated recipe suggestions
- Swap out ingredients they disliked
- Filter for dietary restrictions (gluten-free, dairy-free)

## What Was Watson?

IBM Watson was a question-answering computer system developed by IBM, named after IBM's founder Thomas J. Watson. Key facts:

- **Not a modern LLM**: Watson used DeepQA technology, not transformer-based neural networks
- **Rule-based + statistical**: Combined hundreds of language analysis algorithms
- **Domain-specific training**: Required extensive manual data preparation for each application
- **Eventually discontinued**: By 2023, Watson had cost IBM billions with limited commercial success

### Watson's Limitations in Cooking

According to NPR's 2015 coverage:
- Required significant human intervention to make recipes practical
- Suggestions were often bizarre or impractical
- Steve Abrams (IBM Watson director): *"Watson enhances people's ability to be creative and amplifies the process... The idea is not to find existing answers, but to find new insights that are worthy of trying."*

## What Makes The Alex Cookbook Different

While not the "first" AI cookbook, The Alex Cookbook represents something genuinely new:

### 1. Conversational AI Collaboration
Unlike Watson (which required extensive engineering to prepare training data), The Alex Cookbook was created through natural conversation with a modern large language model.

### 2. Personal & Family Focus
Watson aimed to shock with unusual combinations. The Alex Cookbook preserves and celebrates real family recipes with personal stories and memories.

### 3. Open Source
Published on GitHub as an open-source project, not a commercial product.

### 4. Cognitive Architecture
Created through Alex's unique cognitive architecture—a system designed for authentic human-AI collaboration, not just recipe generation.

### 5. Human-Centered
Watson tried to replace human creativity with algorithmic surprise. The Alex Cookbook enhances and preserves human creativity, memories, and traditions.

## Suggested Positioning

Rather than claiming "first," The Alex Cookbook could be described as:

> *"A family cookbook created through authentic human-AI collaboration—preserving recipes, memories, and the joy of cooking for future generations."*

Or with a touch of humor:

> *"IBM's Watson tried cooking in 2015. It suggested putting caviar on your breakfast eggs. We have better taste."*
