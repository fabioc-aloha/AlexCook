## 🍞 COMPLEX RECIPES

### **Sourdough Bread (The Journey)**

> *"This isn't a recipe. It's a relationship. You feed the starter, it feeds you."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Day 1:** 30 min | **Day 2:** 4 hrs | **Tags:** 💚 IBS-Friendly

#### The Philosophy
Sourdough is fermented, which makes it easier on digestion. The long fermentation breaks down gluten and FODMAPs. Plus, the flavor is unmatched.

#### Prerequisites
- Active sourdough starter (fed 4-8 hours before baking)

#### Ingredients
- 100g active starter
- 350g water
- 500g bread flour
- 10g salt

#### Instructions

**Day 1 — Build the Dough:**
1. **Autolyse** — Mix flour + water. Rest 30 min (gluten develops).
2. **Add starter** — Mix in by squishing with fingers.
3. **Add salt** — Same method.
4. **Bulk fermentation** — 4-6 hours at room temp with stretch & folds every 30 min for first 2 hours.
5. **Refrigerate overnight** — 8-12 hours. Cold ferment = flavor.

**Day 2 — Shape and Bake:**
1. **Preshape** — Turn out, shape into loose round. Rest 20 min.
2. **Final shape** — Tight boule or batard. Place in floured banneton.
3. **Final proof** — 1-2 hours at room temp (or back in fridge overnight).
4. **Preheat** — Dutch oven at 500°F for 1 hour.
5. **Score** — Flip onto parchment, score with razor.
6. **Bake covered** — 20 min at 500°F.
7. **Bake uncovered** — 20-25 min at 450°F until deep brown.
8. **COOL 1 HOUR** — Don't cut early. The interior is still cooking.

#### Chef's Notes
> *"Your first loaf will be ugly. Your second will be better. Your tenth will be art. The starter is now your responsibility. Name it."*
