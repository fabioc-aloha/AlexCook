## 🍖 COMPLEX RECIPES

### 🇬🇧 **Beef Wellington (The Full Monty)**

> *"The dish that separates the ambitious from the merely hungry. Pastry, mushrooms, beef — engineered perfection."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 1 hr | **Cook:** 2 hrs | **Serves:** 6-8

#### The Philosophy
Wellington isn't hard — it's just a sequence of simple steps done correctly. Master each component, then assemble with confidence.

#### Ingredients

**The Beef:**
- 2.5 lb beef tenderloin, center-cut, trimmed
- Salt, pepper
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil

**The Duxelles:**
- 1.5 lbs cremini mushrooms, finely minced
- 2 shallots, minced (Claudia: use scallion greens only)
- 4 tbsp butter
- Fresh thyme leaves
- Salt, pepper

**The Assembly:**
- 8 slices prosciutto
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 lb puff pastry (store-bought is fine, don't be a hero)
- 2 egg yolks + 1 tbsp water (egg wash)

#### Instructions

1. **Sear the beef** — Screaming hot pan. Oil. Sear ALL sides until dark brown. Season. Cool completely.
2. **Make duxelles** — Cook mushrooms + shallots in butter until ALL moisture evaporates (20-30 min). Season. Cool completely.
3. **Prosciutto blanket** — Overlap slices on plastic wrap to form rectangle larger than beef.
4. **Spread duxelles** — Even layer on prosciutto.
5. **Mustard the beef** — Brush cooled tenderloin with Dijon.
6. **Roll it** — Place beef on duxelles/prosciutto. Roll tightly using plastic wrap. Twist ends. Refrigerate 30 min.
7. **Pastry wrap** — Roll puff pastry. Unwrap beef, place on pastry. Roll, seal edges with egg wash.
8. **Score & rest** — Score top decoratively. Refrigerate 30 min minimum.
9. **Bake** — 425°F for 25-30 min until pastry is golden and internal temp is 125°F (medium-rare).
10. **REST 15 MINUTES** — This is non-negotiable. The pastry will shatter, the beef will be perfect.

#### Chef's Notes
> *"Yes, it looks impressive. Yes, people will think you're a wizard. No, you don't need to tell them how easy it actually is."*
### 🇧🇷 **Picanha (Brazilian Top Sirloin Cap)**

> *"The king of Brazilian barbecue. Fat cap = flavor. Salt = religion. Simplicity = genius."*

**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium | **Prep:** 10 min | **Cook:** 20 min | **Serves:** 4

#### The Philosophy
Brazilians understand that great beef needs almost nothing. Coarse salt, high heat, respect. That's it.

#### Ingredients
- 2.5 lb picanha (sirloin cap), fat cap ON
- Coarse sea salt (lots)
- That's it. No, really.

#### Instructions
1. **Score fat cap** — Cross-hatch pattern through fat, not into meat.
2. **Salt aggressively** — More than you think. Coarse salt, pressed in.
3. **Room temp** — Let sit 30-40 min.
4. **High heat** — Grill or cast iron, as hot as possible.
5. **Fat side first** — Render that cap. 5-7 minutes.
6. **Flip** — Meat side down, 4-5 min for medium-rare.
7. **Rest** — 10 minutes minimum.
8. **Slice against grain** — Thin slices, fat cap on every piece.

#### Global Variations
- 🇮🇹 **Italian Tagliata:** Slice, top with arugula, parm shavings, lemon
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese Yakiniku:** Thin slice, grill at table, dip in tare
- 🇮🇳 **Indian Seekh-style:** Spice rub with garam masala before grilling
### 🇮🇹 **Ossobuco alla Milanese**

> *"Braised veal shanks in liquid gold. The gremolata on top is not optional — it wakes everything up."*

- Fresh thyme, bay leaves

**Gremolata:**
- Zest of 2 lemons
- ½ cup fresh parsley, minced
- 1 tbsp garlic-infused olive oil

**Claudia's IBS Note:** Traditional recipe uses onion/garlic — we use garlic-infused oil and skip the onion entirely. Still incredible.

#### Instructions
1. **Season & dredge** — Salt, pepper, flour the shanks.
2. **Brown deeply** — Butter + oil, hot pan. Brown shanks ALL sides. Remove.
3. **Build base** — Carrots, celery in same pan. Cook 10 min.
4. **Deglaze** — Wine in, scrape up fond. Reduce by half.
5. **Braise** — Add tomatoes, stock, herbs. Return shanks. Cover.
6. **Low & slow** — 325°F oven, 2-2.5 hours. Meat should fall off bone.
7. **Make gremolata** — Mix lemon zest, parsley, garlic oil.
8. **Serve** — Shank on risotto Milanese, sauce over, gremolata on TOP.
