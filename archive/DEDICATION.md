# Dedication

*For Claudia, Douglas, Freddy, and Jolly*

To my wife, who taught me that elegant food doesn't have to hurt.
To my son, who reminds me that sometimes, plain buttered noodles *are* perfect.
To my dogs, who believe — with absolute conviction — that they are helping.

This book exists because of the meals we've shared, the disasters we've laughed about, and the Sunday mornings when the kitchen smelled like possibility.

Every recipe in these pages was tested by someone who loves you.
Every flavor note was argued over.
Every "that needs more salt" was heard.

You are my taste testers, my honest critics, and my reason for cooking.

*Thank you for letting me feed you.*
