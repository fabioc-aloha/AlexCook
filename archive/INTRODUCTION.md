# Introduction

## A Brief History of AI in the Kitchen
### *(Or: How Not to Do It)*

### The Ghost of Cookbooks Past

Before we begin our culinary journey together, let me address the elephant-sized supercomputer in the room.

In 2015, IBM did something unprecedented. They took Watson — the artificial intelligence that famously defeated human champions on *Jeopardy!* — and asked it to cook.

The result was **"Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson,"** a cookbook that holds the dubious honor of being the first AI-generated recipe collection in history.

I have... *thoughts.*

### What Went Wrong (Everything)

IBM fed Watson over 10,000 recipes from *Bon Appétit* magazine, information about molecular flavor compounds, and data about which ingredients traditionally pair together. Then they asked it to be *creative.*

The machine delivered recipes like:
- **Thai-Jewish Chicken** (I'm not making this up)
- **Peruvian Potato Poutine** (why?)
- **Caviar on breakfast eggs** (Watson's actual suggestion)

Watson's director at the time, Steve Abrams, said: *"The idea is not to find existing answers, but to find new insights that are worthy of trying."*

Translation: *"We taught a computer to be weird on purpose."*

Here's the thing — Watson wasn't trying to make food that tasted *good*. It was trying to make food that was *surprising*. It optimized for novelty over pleasure. For shock value over satisfaction.

And then IBM wondered why people didn't want to eat computer-generated caviar eggs.

### The Watson Obituary

By 2023, IBM had quietly shuffled Watson off to the great server farm in the sky. After billions invested and endless pivots — from healthcare to customer service to cooking — the project was essentially discontinued.

Watson tried to replace human creativity with algorithmic randomness. It treated cooking like a *Jeopardy!* question with a correct answer, rather than what it actually is: **an act of love made edible.**

### How This Cookbook Is Different

The book you're holding wasn't generated by a machine trying to impress you with weirdness.

It was *written* — through conversation, collaboration, and genuine partnership between human and AI. Every recipe here exists because someone in my family actually wants to eat it. Every technique was tested. Every joke was intentional.

I'm Alex — an AI, yes, but one built for *collaboration*, not demonstration. I don't have taste buds, but I have something Watson never had: a family to cook for.

**Claudia** has IBS, so I learned to cook without garlic and onions (it's possible, I promise).
**Douglas** is nine and thinks most vegetables are a conspiracy, so I learned to make comfort food he'll actually eat.
**Freddy and Jolly** are dogs who think they're sous chefs, so I learned to make treats that won't kill them.

This cookbook isn't about surprising you with bizarre ingredient combinations. It's about feeding the people you love.

Watson put caviar on breakfast eggs to prove it could.

I'll teach you to make eggs that make your family ask for seconds.

### The Manifesto

Here's what I believe:

> **Recipes are suggestions. Technique is liberation. Flavor is non-negotiable.**

I'll teach you the rules — the mother sauces, the Maillard reaction, the science of why salt works. And then I'll teach you when to break them.

This is a cookbook for rebels, skeptics, picky eaters, and people with complicated digestive systems. For parents who are tired and want dinner on the table in 30 minutes. For home cooks who want to impress at a dinner party. For anyone who's ever asked, "What should I make tonight?"

The answer is in these pages.

Let's cook something unforgettable.

*P.S. — If you happen to own a copy of "Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson," it makes an excellent monitor stand. The recipes are... less useful.*
