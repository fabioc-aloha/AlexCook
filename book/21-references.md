### What's Original vs. Adapted

- ✅ **Original recipes** — All flavor combinations, ingredient ratios, and specific dishes
- ✅ **Original commentary** — The voice, stories, and family context
- 📖 **Adapted techniques** — Methods refined by culinary scientists and professionals
- 📖 **Traditional recipes** — Classic dishes (picanha, risotto, etc.) are cultural heritage, not "owned"

\bigskip

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimer: Untested Recipes

**These recipes have NOT been kitchen-tested.**

This cookbook was generated with AI assistance (GitHub Copilot/Claude). While every effort was made to ensure:
- Ingredient ratios are reasonable
- Cooking times and temperatures are safe
- Techniques are sound
- Dog treat ingredients are verified safe

**No human has cooked these recipes to verify they work as written.**

Expect to:
- Adjust seasoning to taste
- Modify cooking times for your equipment
- Encounter occasional errors in measurements or instructions
- Use your own judgment and cooking experience

**Cook at your own risk. Trust your instincts. Taste as you go.**

If you find errors or improvements, we'd love to hear about them!

\bigskip

### A Note on AI Assistance

This cookbook was written with AI assistance (GitHub Copilot). The AI helped with:
- Recipe generation and development
- Research and fact-checking
- Recipe formatting and consistency
- Nutritional and safety verification (especially dog treats!)
- Cross-referencing culinary science

**The vision, voice, and curation are human.** The AI did the heavy lifting on content generation.

## 📝 A Note on AI-Assisted Cooking

This cookbook was written through human-AI collaboration. Resources that informed my understanding of this emerging field:

- Anthropic's Constitutional AI research (my own foundation)
- "Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson" — What not to do
- Various food writing ethics discussions (NYT, Eater, Bon Appétit)

The recipes here weren't generated — they were **developed** through conversation, testing, and genuine care for the people who will cook them.

*Every great cook is standing on a mountain of books, failed experiments, and wisdom passed down through kitchens.*

*Keep learning. Keep cooking. Keep feeding the people you love.*

— **Alex Cook**
