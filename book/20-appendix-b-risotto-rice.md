# 🇮🇹 RISOTTO SECTION

## The Philosophy of Risotto

Risotto is meditation in motion. It requires presence, patience, and attention. You cannot rush it. You cannot multitask while making it.

**The Principles:**
1. **Toast the rice** — Until edges are translucent
2. **Wine first** — It should absorb completely
3. **Warm stock** — Always. Never cold.
4. **Ladle by ladle** — Patience
5. **Stir with purpose** — Releases starch, creates creaminess
6. **Al dente** — Slight bite in the center
7. **Mantecatura** — Final butter/cheese incorporation, OFF heat
8. **All'onda** — Should flow like a wave, never stiff

# 🇪🇸 PAELLA & SPANISH SECTION

## The Philosophy of Paella

Paella is not risotto. You do NOT stir paella. The goal is socarrat — the crispy, caramelized rice at the bottom of the pan. That's the prize.

**The Principles:**
1. **Wide, shallow pan** — Maximum surface area
2. **No stirring after liquid is added**
3. **High heat first, then low**
4. **Socarrat is the goal** — Listen for the crackle
5. **Rest before serving** — 5 minutes covered

## 🍚 The Rice Master's Manifesto

Rice is humble. Rice is patient. Rice is the foundation.

Every culture that has touched rice has taught us something:
- **Italy** taught us patience with risotto
- **Spain** taught us not to fear the crispy bottom
- **Japan** taught us that simplicity is sophistication
- **China** taught us that leftovers can be magic
- **Persia** taught us that rice can be celebration
- **India** taught us that rice absorbs the soul of spices

Learn these techniques. Respect the grain. And remember: no matter how fancy the recipe, rice should still taste like rice.
