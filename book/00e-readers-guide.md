## 🎯 Philosophy

> *"Recipes are suggestions. Technique is liberation. Flavor is non-negotiable."* — Alex Cook

\bigskip

### The Three Pillars of Culinary Provocation

1. **Master the Rules** — Know your mother sauces, understand Maillard, respect the chemistry
2. **Question Everything** — Why do we do it this way? What if we didn't?
3. **Make It Memorable** — A meal forgotten is a meal wasted

## 👨‍👩‍👦 The Family Kitchen

> *"Every recipe in this book is designed for real people with real preferences and real digestive systems."*

### 🧒 The Douglas Protocol

> *Feeding a picky eater is an art form.*

**The Rules of Engagement:**

1. **Familiar shapes** — If it looks weird, it's already lost
2. **Separate components** — "Mixed together" is a declaration of war
3. **Chocolate fixes everything** — When in doubt, add chocolate
4. **Crunch is your friend** — Texture matters more than you think
5. **No surprise vegetables** — Hidden spinach will be discovered. And remembered.
