## 🫙 COMPLEX RECIPES

### **Classic Hollandaise**

> *"The sauce that terrifies home cooks. Don't be scared. It's just warm, buttery mayonnaise."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 5 min | **Cook:** 10 min | **Makes:** 1 cup

#### The Philosophy
Hollandaise breaks because of two things: heat too high, or butter added too fast. Control those, and you're golden. Literally.

#### Ingredients
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 stick (8 tbsp) butter, melted and HOT
- Pinch cayenne
- Salt

#### Instructions
1. **Double boiler setup** — Bowl over simmering water, NOT touching water.
2. **Whisk yolks** — Add lemon juice + water. Whisk constantly.
3. **Watch for thickness** — 3-4 min of whisking until ribbons form.
4. **Remove from heat** — This is important!
5. **Stream butter** — SLOWLY. Thin stream while whisking. Too fast = broken sauce.
6. **Season** — Cayenne, salt, more lemon if needed.
7. **Keep warm** — Bowl over warm (not hot) water until serving.

#### Rescue a Broken Hollandaise
1. Start with 1 fresh yolk in clean bowl
2. Whisk in broken sauce VERY slowly
3. It will re-emulsify. Magic.

### **Beurre Blanc (White Butter Sauce)**

> *"French. Elegant. Just butter held together by willpower and acid."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 5 min | **Cook:** 15 min | **Makes:** 1 cup | **Tags:** 💚 IBS-Friendly

#### Ingredients
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 2 shallots, minced fine (Claudia: use garlic-infused oil + green onion tops)
- 1 cup (2 sticks) cold butter, cubed
- Salt, white pepper

#### Instructions
1. **Reduce** — Wine + vinegar + shallots. Simmer until almost gone (2-3 tbsp liquid left).
2. **Low heat** — Lowest setting.
3. **Cold butter, piece by piece** — Add one cube at a time, whisking. Don't add next until first is incorporated.
4. **Never boil** — Keep it just warm enough to melt butter. Boiling = broken sauce.
5. **Strain** — Remove shallots if desired.
6. **Season** — Salt, white pepper.
7. **Serve immediately** — Over fish, vegetables, chicken.
