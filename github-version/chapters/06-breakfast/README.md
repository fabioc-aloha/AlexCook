## 🍳 COMPLEX RECIPES

### **Eggs Benedict (The Template)**

> *"Master the hollandaise. The rest is just assembly. And the hollandaise isn't even that hard."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 20 min | **Cook:** 20 min | **Serves:** 4

#### The Philosophy
Eggs Benedict intimidates people because of hollandaise. Stop being scared. It's just warm mayonnaise with butter and lemon.

#### Ingredients

**Hollandaise:**
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp water
- 8 tbsp (1 stick) butter, melted and HOT
- Pinch of cayenne
- Salt

**Assembly:**
- 4 English muffins, split and toasted
- 8 slices Canadian bacon (or ham)
- 8 eggs for poaching
- White vinegar for poaching water

#### Instructions

**Make Hollandaise:**
1. **Whisk yolks** — Yolks + lemon juice + water in bowl over simmering water (not touching).
2. **Whisk constantly** — Until thickened and ribbony, 3-4 min.
3. **Stream butter** — Remove from heat. Add hot butter in slow stream while whisking.
4. **Season** — Cayenne, salt, more lemon if needed.
5. **Keep warm** — Bowl over warm (not hot) water.

**Poach Eggs:**
1. **Vinegar water** — Bring water to simmer with splash of vinegar.
2. **Vortex method** — Stir water, drop egg in center. Cook 3 min for runny.
3. **Multiple eggs** — Skip vortex, just slide eggs in gently. Fish out with slotted spoon.

**Assemble:**
1. Muffin → bacon → egg → hollandaise → cayenne sprinkle.
2. **Serve immediately** — This dish doesn't wait.

#### Variations
- 🇮🇹 **Florentine:** Spinach instead of bacon
- 🇧🇷 **Brasileira:** Add chimichurri to the hollandaise
- 🇯🇵 **Tokyo Style:** Teriyaki glazed pork belly, wasabi hollandaise
- 💚 **Claudia's Version:** Skip English muffin, serve over roasted potatoes
