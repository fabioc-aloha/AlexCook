## 🎉 CELEBRATION RECIPES

### **Standing Rib Roast (Christmas Centerpiece)**

> *"This is the dish that makes everyone put down their phones and just stare."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 30 min | **Cook:** 3 hrs | **Rest:** 45 min | **Serves:** 8-10

#### The Philosophy
The reverse sear method means edge-to-edge perfection. Low heat builds to temperature, high heat creates the crust. Trust the thermometer.

#### Ingredients
- 1 standing rib roast, 4-bone (10-12 lbs)
- Coarse salt (1 tbsp per pound)
- Fresh ground pepper
- Fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary)
- 4 tbsp softened butter
- 1 head of garlic, minced (use garlic-infused oil for Claudia)

#### Instructions

**Day Before:**
1. **Dry brine** — Salt generously all over. Refrigerate uncovered overnight.

**Day Of:**
1. **Room temp** — Pull roast 2 hours before cooking.
2. **Herb butter** — Mix butter + herbs + garlic.
3. **Rub roast** — Herb butter all over.
4. **Low heat** — 250°F until internal temp hits 110°F (about 2-2.5 hrs).
5. **Rest** — Remove, tent with foil. Rest 30 min. Temp will rise to 120°F.
6. **Crank heat** — 500°F.
7. **Blast** — Return roast, 10-15 min until crust forms and internal hits 125°F (rare).
8. **Final rest** — 15 min before carving.

#### Chef's Notes
> *"This is the only dish where I check the thermometer every 15 minutes. I regret nothing."*
