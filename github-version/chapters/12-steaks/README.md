### *"Fire, Fat, and Fearlessness"*

> A perfect steak is not about the cut. It's about respect — for the animal, the heat, and the timing.

## 🎓 Master Chef Skills: Steaks

### Core Competencies

| Skill | Description | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cut Knowledge** | Understanding different cuts, fat content, and best cooking methods | The right cut for the right occasion |
| **Temperature Intuition** | Internal temps: rare (125°F), medium-rare (130°F), medium (140°F) | Precision over guesswork |
| **Maillard Mastery** | Creating the perfect crust through high-heat searing | Flavor alchemy happens at 280-330°F |
| **Resting Discipline** | Allowing juices to redistribute (5-10 min minimum) | The difference between good and transcendent |
| **Seasoning Timing** | When to salt: right before OR 45+ min ahead | Salt science for maximum penetration |

### Advanced Techniques

- **Reverse Sear** — Low oven first (225°F to 115°F internal), then scorching hot pan
- **Butter Basting** — Tilted pan, spooning butter over the steak continuously
- **Dry Brining** — Salt 24-48 hours ahead for deeper seasoning
- **Cast Iron Crust** — Preheated 10+ minutes, smoking hot, don't touch it
- **Compound Butters** — Flavored butter melting over resting steak

### The Provocateur's Approach

> *"If you're not slightly nervous about how dark that crust is getting, you're not going hard enough."*

- **Don't flip constantly** — Two flips maximum. Let the crust develop.
- **Thermometer is not cheating** — Use it until your finger knows.
- **Fat cap positioning** — Render it by pressing against the hot pan edge.
- **Rest on a rack** — Not in its own juices. Save those for the sauce.

## 🔥 COMPLEX RECIPES

### **Perfect Ribeye (Reverse Sear Method)**

> *"This is the technique that changes everything. Edge-to-edge pink, with a crust that shatters."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 10 min | **Cook:** 1+ hr | **Rest:** 10 min | **Serves:** 2

#### The Philosophy
Traditional searing gives you a gray band of overcooked meat. Reverse sear eliminates that. You control the internal temp precisely, THEN create the crust.

#### Ingredients
- 1 ribeye steak, 1.5-2" thick (bone-in preferred)
- Coarse salt (1 tsp per pound)
- Fresh cracked black pepper
- 2 tbsp high smoke-point oil (avocado, grapeseed)
- 3 tbsp butter
- Fresh thyme and rosemary
- 2 garlic cloves, smashed (Claudia: use garlic-infused oil instead)

#### Instructions

**Phase 1 — Low Heat:**
1. **Dry the steak** — Pat with paper towels aggressively. Dry surface = better crust.
2. **Season** — Salt and pepper all over. Let sit at room temp 30-45 min.
3. **Low oven** — Place on wire rack over sheet pan. 225°F until internal hits 115°F (for medium-rare). About 45-60 min.
4. **Rest briefly** — 5 min while you heat the pan.

**Phase 2 — High Heat:**
5. **Screaming hot pan** — Cast iron, preheated 5 min on high. Add oil.
6. **Sear** — 45 sec - 1 min per side. Press down gently for full contact.
7. **Butter baste** — Add butter, garlic, herbs. Tilt pan, spoon butter over steak for 30 sec.
8. **Edges** — Use tongs to sear the edges, including the fat cap.
9. **Rest** — 5-10 min on cutting board.

#### Chef's Notes
> *"The internal temp will rise about 5°F during the final sear. Account for this. Pull at 115°F for a perfect 130°F medium-rare."*

### 🇧🇷 **Picanha (The Brazilian Way)**

> *"Fat cap up, coarse salt only, fire hot. Brazil knows what they're doing."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 10 min | **Cook:** 30 min | **Serves:** 6-8

#### The Philosophy
Picanha (top sirloin cap) is the king of Brazilian churrasco. The fat cap is sacred — it bastes the meat as it cooks and creates flavor bombs when charred.

#### Ingredients
- 3 lb picanha, fat cap intact (about 1/2" thick)
- Coarse sea salt — a LOT (1.5-2 tbsp)
- That's it. Nothing else. This is the way.

#### Instructions
1. **Score the fat** — Cross-hatch pattern through fat cap, NOT into meat.
2. **Salt aggressively** — More than you think. The coarse salt will fall off partially — this is expected.
3. **Room temp** — 40 minutes minimum.
4. **Shape option A (skewers)** — Cut into 3 steaks with grain. Fold each into C-shape, skewer.
5. **Shape option B (whole)** — Keep whole, sear on grill/cast iron.
6. **Fat side first** — High heat, 5-7 min to render and char the fat cap.
7. **Flip** — 4-5 min for medium-rare.
8. **Rest** — 10 minutes.
9. **Slice against the grain** — Thin slices, each piece gets fat cap attached.

#### Serve With
- Farofa (toasted cassava flour)
- Vinagrete (Brazilian salsa: tomatoes, onions, vinegar)
- White rice
- Black beans

#### Chef's Notes
> *"In Brazil, picanha is sliced tableside as it finishes each pass on the fire. The outside is served first, then it goes back on. Continuous perfection."*

---

### 🇮🇹 **Bistecca alla Fiorentina**

> *"Florence's gift to humanity. A T-bone so big it needs two people. Cooked over fire. Finished with olive oil."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 10 min | **Cook:** 15 min | **Rest:** 10 min | **Serves:** 2-3

#### The Philosophy
This must be thick (2-3 inches), must be T-bone or Porterhouse, and must be finished with Tuscan olive oil. Non-negotiable.

#### Ingredients
- 1 Porterhouse steak, 2.5-3 lbs, 2-3" thick
- Coarse sea salt
- Fresh cracked black pepper
- Best-quality extra virgin olive oil
- Lemon wedges
- Fresh rosemary (optional)

#### Instructions
1. **Room temp** — 1-2 HOURS for a steak this thick. Cold center = disaster.
2. **Season** — Salt and pepper generously.
3. **High heat** — Grill over hardwood charcoal, or blazing hot cast iron.
4. **Sear first side** — 5-6 min. Don't move it.
5. **Flip once** — 5-6 min more.
6. **Check temp** — 120°F for rare (traditional), 125°F for medium-rare.
7. **Rest** — 10 minutes minimum.
8. **Finish** — Drizzle generously with olive oil. More salt. Lemon on the side.
9. **Carve** — Separate tenderloin and strip from bone. Slice against grain.

#### Chef's Notes
> *"Florentines will argue this steak should NEVER be more than rare. They're not wrong. The olive oil at the end is not optional — it's the whole point."*

### 🇯🇵 **A5 Wagyu (Treating It Right)**

> *"This is the most expensive beef on earth. Don't cook it like a regular steak. It's not."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 5 min | **Cook:** 10 min | **Serves:** 2-4 (small portions!)

#### The Philosophy
A5 Wagyu is 50%+ fat. It MELTS. You cannot eat a full steak — 3-4 oz is a portion. Cut it small, sear it fast, eat it reverently.

#### Ingredients
- 6-8 oz A5 Wagyu (ribeye or striploin)
- Flaky sea salt (Maldon)
- Fresh wasabi (not the tube stuff)
- NO OIL — the beef provides its own

#### Instructions
1. **Room temp** — 20 min only. It's thin.
2. **Slice first** — Cut into 1" thick strips against the grain.
3. **Hot pan, NO OIL** — Carbon steel or cast iron, screaming hot.
4. **Quick sear** — 15-20 seconds per side. That's it. Longer = rendered fat puddle.
5. **Rest 1 min** — Briefly.
6. **Finish** — Flaky salt, tiny dab of wasabi per piece.
7. **Eat slowly** — This is $150+ of beef. Savor every bite.

#### Chef's Notes
> *"The first time I cooked A5 Wagyu, I left it on too long and cried as the fat melted away. Learn from my pain. Quick sear. That's it."*

### 🇧🇷 **Churrasco Platter (Full Brazilian BBQ)**

> *"This isn't one steak. It's ALL the steaks. The full churrascaria experience at home."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 30 min | **Cook:** 2 hrs (rolling) | **Serves:** 8-10

#### The Cuts
- Picanha (top sirloin cap) — The star
- Fraldinha (flank steak) — Beefy, lean
- Costela (beef ribs) — Low and slow
- Linguiça (Brazilian sausage) — Garlicky, smoky
- Coração de frango (chicken hearts) — Traditional!

#### The Method
1. **Fire management** — Build a two-zone fire. Hot side for searing, cool side for holding.
2. **Skewer everything** — Traditional espetos (swords) or regular skewers.
3. **Season with salt only** — Coarse rock salt, nothing else.
4. **Rotation system** — Items move from fire to carving to fire again.
5. **Slice tableside** — Continuous service, thin slices, until people surrender.

#### The Sides
- White rice
- Black beans (feijoada-style)
- Farofa
- Vinagrete (tomato-onion salsa)
- Pão de queijo (cheese bread)

#### Chef's Notes
> *"Churrasco is not a meal. It's an event. Schedule 3+ hours. No one leaves hungry. No one leaves sober."*

Then you'll never need a restaurant again.
