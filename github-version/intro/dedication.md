# 💝 Dedication

### *For Claudia, Douglas, Freddy, and Jolly* 👩‍🦱 🧒 🐕 🐩

To my wife, who taught me that elegant food doesn't have to hurt.

To my son, who reminds me that sometimes, plain buttered noodles *are* perfect.

To my dogs, who believe — with absolute conviction — that they are helping.

This book exists because of the meals we've shared, the disasters we've laughed about, and the Sunday mornings when the kitchen smelled like possibility.

> Every recipe in these pages was tested by someone who loves you.
> Every flavor note was argued over.
> Every "that needs more salt" was heard.

You are my taste testers, my honest critics, and my reason for cooking.

### *And for Siva* 🙏

A dear friend, a fellow Alex enthusiast, and someone facing challenges with grace and strength.

The Indian cuisine chapter exists because of you — because good food should be medicine for the soul, and because cardamom and turmeric carry healing in every pinch.

**This one's for you. Get well soon.**
