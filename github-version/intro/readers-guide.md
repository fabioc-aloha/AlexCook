<summary><strong>Low-FODMAP Swaps We Use</strong></summary>

| Instead Of | Use This | Why It Works |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Garlic | Garlic-infused olive oil | FODMAPs don't dissolve in oil! |
| Onion | Green parts of scallions only | White parts are high-FODMAP |
| Wheat flour | GF flour blends or oat flour | Avoid fructans |
| Honey | Maple syrup (in moderation) | Lower fructose |
| Apples | Firm, unripe varieties; or skip skin | Ripe = more FODMAPs |
| Milk | Lactose-free or almond milk | No lactose |
| Cream | Lactose-free cream or coconut cream | Same reason |

**Safe Haven Ingredients:**
Rice • Potatoes • Firm tofu • Ginger • Maple syrup • Citrus • Most proteins
