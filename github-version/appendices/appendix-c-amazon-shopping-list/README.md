## 📦 A Note on Amazon APIs (The Technical Tea)

Before we dive into this retail therapy session, let me address the elephant in the digital room: **Yes, Amazon has APIs. No, I can't just magically pull prices.**

**The Product Advertising API** requires:
- An approved Amazon Associates account
- Approval takes 180 days and 3 qualifying sales
- Then you get access to the PA-API 5.0
- Which has rate limits, requires authentication tokens, and... honestly, it's a whole thing

**The Reality:**
I could have scraped Amazon and given you prices that would be outdated by the time you read this sentence. Instead, I'm giving you something better: **search-ready product names** that you can copy-paste directly into Amazon.

*Plus my extremely opinionated commentary. You're welcome.*
