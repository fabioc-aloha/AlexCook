### Core Competencies

| Skill | Description | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|

| **Emulsification** | Creating stable vinaigrettes and creamy soups | Texture that clings and coats |
| **Acid Balance** | Vinegars, citrus, fermented elements | Brightness cuts richness |
| **Temperature Mastery** | Hot soups hot, cold soups cold, gazpacho perfect | Temperature is a flavor |
| **Layered Seasoning** | Salt at every stage, not just at the end | Depth vs. surface flavor |

### Advanced Techniques

## 🍲 COMPLEX RECIPES

### 🇧🇷 **Moqueca Baiana (Brazilian Fish Stew)**

> *"This is the dish that makes people book flights to Salvador. Dendê oil, coconut milk, and fish so fresh it practically swam into the pot."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 30 min | **Cook:** 1 hr | **Serves:** 6 | **Tags:** 💚 IBS-Friendly

#### The Philosophy
Moqueca is not a soup — it's a meditation. Layers built slowly, coconut milk that doesn't boil but simmers, and fish that barely holds together from tenderness.

#### Ingredients
- 2 lbs firm white fish (cod, halibut, or mahi-mahi), cut into chunks
- Juice of 3 limes
- 2 tbsp garlic-infused olive oil (LOW-FODMAP swap for garlic)
- 2 bell peppers (red + yellow), sliced
- 4 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
- 1 can (400ml) full-fat coconut milk
- 2 tbsp dendê oil (palm oil) — *the soul of the dish*
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Salt to taste

**Claudia's IBS Note:** Skip raw onions entirely. The garlic-infused oil provides depth without FODMAPs.

#### Instructions
1. **Marinate fish** — Lime juice, salt, 30 minutes minimum. Acid = flavor.
2. **Build the base** — Garlic oil, medium heat. Add peppers, cook 5 min until softened.
3. **Tomato layer** — Add tomatoes, cook until they break down (10 min).
4. **Fish nestling** — Lay fish on top of vegetables. DO NOT STIR.
5. **Coconut bath** — Pour coconut milk over everything. Still don't stir.
6. **Dendê magic** — Drizzle palm oil on top. It will create orange rivers.
7. **Simmer gently** — 20-25 minutes, covered. Fish flakes = done.
8. **Cilantro shower** — Finish with fresh herbs. Serve with white rice.

#### Global Variations
- 🇮🇹 **Italian:** Swap coconut for white wine + tomatoes = Cioppino style
- 🇮🇳 **Indian:** Add curry paste, use mustard oil instead of dendê
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese:** Miso-coconut broth, add bok choy, top with nori

### 🇮🇹 **Minestrone di Casa (The Proper Italian Way)**

> *"Every Italian grandmother has her version. This is mine. Fight me."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 30 min | **Cook:** 1.5 hrs | **Serves:** 8 | **Tags:** 💚 IBS-Friendly

#### The Philosophy
Minestrone is not vegetable soup with pasta. It's a vegetable garden that fell into a pot and achieved transcendence.

#### Ingredients
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 3 carrots, diced
- 2 medium zucchini, diced
- 1 can cannellini beans, drained (or fresh if you're ambitious)
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 6 cups low-FODMAP vegetable stock
- 1 cup small pasta (ditalini)
- 2 cups kale or spinach, chopped
- Parmesan rind (SAVE YOUR RINDS!)
- Fresh basil
- Salt, pepper

**Claudia's IBS Note:** Canned beans are lower FODMAP than dried (rinsing removes oligosaccharides). Limit to ¼ cup per serving.

#### Instructions
1. **Soffritto base** — Oil + celery + carrots, medium heat, 10 minutes. Patience here.
2. **Zucchini in** — Add zucchini, cook 5 more minutes.
3. **Tomato time** — Add canned tomatoes, stir and cook 5 min.
4. **Stock pour** — Add stock + parmesan rind. Bring to boil, then simmer 45 min.
5. **Bean addition** — Add beans, cook 15 min more.
6. **Pasta finish** — Add pasta directly to soup. Cook until al dente.
7. **Greens wilt** — Stir in kale/spinach at the very end.
8. **Rest 10 min** — Soup improves with a brief rest. Top with basil, olive oil drizzle.

### 🇯🇵 **Tonkotsu-Style Miso Ramen**

> *"Real ramen takes 12+ hours. This 'cheater' version takes 3 and still makes restaurant ramen weep."*

**Difficulty:** 🔴 Complex | **Prep:** 45 min | **Cook:** 2.5 hrs | **Serves:** 4

#### The Philosophy
Ramen is engineering. Broth, tare, aroma oil, noodles, toppings — each component perfected separately.

#### Ingredients
**Broth:**
- 2 lbs pork bones (ask butcher for femur/neck bones)
- 1 lb chicken backs or wings
- 6 cups water
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil

**Tare (seasoning base):**
- 3 tbsp white miso paste
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sake
- 1 tsp sesame oil

**Toppings:**
- 4 soft-boiled eggs (6.5 minute eggs, marinated)
- Chashu pork belly (or store-bought)
- Corn kernels
- Green onion greens (LOW-FODMAP portion of scallions)
- Nori sheets
- Fresh ramen noodles

#### Instructions
1. **Blanch bones** — Boil 10 min, drain, rinse off scum. Clean pot.
2. **Roast bones** — 400°F, 30 min until golden. Flavor foundation.
3. **Build broth** — Bones + water. Boil HARD for 2 hours. The rolling boil emulsifies fat = creamy broth.
4. **Make tare** — Whisk miso + soy + sake + sesame. Set aside.
5. **Marinate eggs** — 6.5-min eggs in soy + mirin overnight.
6. **Assemble bowls** — 2 tbsp tare in bowl → hot broth → noodles → toppings arranged beautifully.

## Chapter Notes

The French built an empire on stock. The Italians conquered with olive oil and acid. Master both traditions, then create your own.
