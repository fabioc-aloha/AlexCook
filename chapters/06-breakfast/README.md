## 🎓 Master Chef Skills: Breakfast

### Core Competencies

| Skill | Description | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Egg Mastery** | Scrambled (French vs American), poached, fried, basted | The egg is the ultimate test |
| **Timing Choreography** | Everything hot and ready simultaneously | Cold eggs haunt reputations |
| **Batter Science** | Gluten development, resting, leavening agents | Pancakes vs hockey pucks |
| **Heat Control** | Low and slow for eggs, high for crispy edges | Temperature discipline |
| **Mise en Place** | Everything prepped before the first pan heats | Breakfast waits for no one |

### Advanced Techniques

- **French Scrambled Eggs** — Low heat, constant stirring, crème fraîche finish
- **Perfect Poaching** — Vinegar, vortex, 3-minute precision
- **Hollandaise Mastery** — Emulsion stability, acid balance, temperature control
- **Sourdough Discard Recipes** — Waste nothing, flavor everything
- **Bacon Weave Architecture** — Because presentation matters at 8 AM

### The Provocateur's Approach

> *"If your scrambled eggs don't make someone question everything they've known about eggs, you're doing it wrong."*

- **Sweet meets savory** — Bacon in pancakes, maple on eggs, honey on cheese
- **Brunch is theater** — Bloody Marys with architectural garnishes
- **Eggs Benedict variations** — Master the template, then destroy it beautifully
- **Coffee as ingredient** — Not just a beverage, an enhancement
