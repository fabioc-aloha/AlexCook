## 🎓 Master Chef Skills: Appetizers

### Core Competencies

| Skill | Description | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Mise en Place** | Everything in its place before you begin | Speed and precision under pressure |
| **Knife Precision** | Uniform cuts: brunoise, julienne, chiffonade | Visual appeal and even cooking |
| **Textural Contrast** | Crispy meets creamy, crunchy meets smooth | Multi-sensory engagement |
| **Visual Seduction** | Color theory, negative space, height | We eat with our eyes first |
| **Portion Control** | Enough to tantalize, never to satisfy | Leave them wanting more |

### Advanced Techniques

- **Spherification** — Encapsulating liquids in gel membranes (molecular gastronomy)
- **Foam Creation** — Using lecithin or agar for airy, flavorful foams
- **Curing & Pickling** — Quick pickles for acid brightness
- **Temperature Play** — Hot-cold combinations that surprise

### The Provocateur's Approach

> *"An appetizer that doesn't make someone pause mid-conversation has failed its only job."*

- **Challenge expectation** — Serve something familiar in an unfamiliar way
- **Engage all senses** — Sound (crunch), smell (aromatics), touch (temperature)
- **Tell a micro-story** — Each bite should have a beginning, middle, and end
