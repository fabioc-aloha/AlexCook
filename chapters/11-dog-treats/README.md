# 🐕 Chapter 11: Treats for the Pack

### *"Because They're Family, Not Just Pets"*

> Freddy and Jolly don't just live here — they believe they run the kitchen. Spoiler: they do not. But they're convinced that standing directly in front of the stove and staring at you while you cook constitutes "helping." This chapter is their reward for being adorably in the way.

## 🎓 Master Chef Skills: Dog Treats

### Core Competencies

| Skill | Description | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Ingredient Safety** | Knowing what's toxic vs. safe | Their lives depend on it |
| **Protein Selection** | Lean meats, organ meats, fish | Dogs are carnivore-leaning omnivores |
| **Texture Control** | Crunchy vs. chewy vs. frozen | Different dogs, different preferences |
| **Portion Wisdom** | Treats = 10% of daily calories max | Love doesn't mean overfeeding |
| **Storage Smarts** | Refrigeration, freezing, shelf-stable | Homemade = no preservatives |

### The Provocateur's Approach

> *"If you wouldn't eat it, don't feed it to them. Okay, maybe not the liver treats. But you get the idea."*

- **Real ingredients** — No fillers, no mystery meat, no artificial anything
- **Functional treats** — Dental health, joint support, shiny coats
- **Training currency** — Small, high-value, instantly devourable
- **Birthday worthy** — Yes, dogs deserve birthday cakes too

- **Actual Role** — Kitchen annoyances who we love desperately
- **Cucumber Enthusiasts** — Especially the skins. ESPECIALLY the skins.
- **Quality Control** — Everything that hits the floor gets inspected
- **Therapy Providers** — Bad day? Dog cuddles fix it
- **Unconditional Love Machines** — They think they're helping. They are not. But we love them anyway.

This chapter is for them. Because in the Alex household, **everyone eats well**.
