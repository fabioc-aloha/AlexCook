## 🎓 Master Chef Skills: Dog Treats

### Core Competencies

| Skill | Description | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Ingredient Safety** | Knowing what's toxic vs. safe | Their lives depend on it |
| **Protein Selection** | Lean meats, organ meats, fish | Dogs are carnivore-leaning omnivores |
| **Texture Control** | Crunchy vs. chewy vs. frozen | Different dogs, different preferences |
| **Portion Wisdom** | Treats = 10% of daily calories max | Love doesn't mean overfeeding |
| **Storage Smarts** | Refrigeration, freezing, shelf-stable | Homemade = no preservatives |

### The Provocateur's Approach

> *"If you wouldn't eat it, don't feed it to them. Okay, maybe not the liver treats. But you get the idea."*

- **Real ingredients** — No fillers, no mystery meat, no artificial anything
- **Functional treats** — Dental health, joint support, shiny coats
- **Training currency** — Small, high-value, instantly devourable
- **Birthday worthy** — Yes, dogs deserve birthday cakes too
